# Back-end models and controllers

### Duration

You have 1.5 hours to complete this task.

### Team

For this task, you will start coding along with the trainer and then finish off individually.

## Brief

Refactor the quote API code from the first debug assignment to use the MVC pattern. Since the quotes API has no views this means refactoring to use models and controllers. 

## Setup
Check that the API server works:
- Run `npm install` inside the [quotes-api](./quotes-api) folder
- Run `npm run dev` inside the [quotes-api](./quotes-api) folder
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
